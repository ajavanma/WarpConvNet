"""Regression tests for issue #9: PointMinkUNet passed unsupported ``return_type="sparse"``.

Before fix: ``PointMinkUNetBase.forward`` crashed with an assertion from
``warpconvnet.nn.functional.point_pool.point_pool`` because the functional
signature is ``Literal["point", "voxel"]`` but the model passed ``"sparse"``.

These tests would have failed before the fix and pass after.
