"""Regression tests for issue #11: dtype mismatch in point_pool max-points branch.

Reporter's scenario: ``point_pool(..., downsample_max_num_points=N,
return_type="voxel")`` on default float-coordinate ``Points`` first crashed
inside ``IntCoords`` with "Discrete coordinates must be integers", and when
the caller cast coordinates to int as a workaround, the max-points kNN
reduction then crashed with ``RuntimeError: cdist only supports
floating-point dtypes``.

Resolution: reject the unsupported combination
``downsample_max_num_points=...`` + ``return_type='voxel'`` clearly in
``point_pool``, with a message pointing to the supported alternative
(``downsample_voxel_size``). Max-point sampling operates on continuous
coordinates and has no defined voxel grid to discretise onto — silently
casting coordinates to int would change spatial semantics and break
nearest-neighbour reduction (``torch.cdist`` requires floats, as the
reporter's second traceback demonstrated).
