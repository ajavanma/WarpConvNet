"""Blackwell handoff §3 regression tests: exact-arch + backend authorization.

Every candidate path — normal selection, pinned tile ids, and cached autotune
records — must validate ``device_arch in compile_archs`` (exact membership, no
``>=`` inference) and a launchable backend before entering the C++ dispatch
switch. The sm100_umma backend is a nonlaunchable scaffold and must never be
selected, on any device.
