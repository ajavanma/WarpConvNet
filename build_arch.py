"""Exact CUDA architecture handling for the extension build.

PyTorch's architecture parser changes with the installed PyTorch release and
has historically expanded named architecture families (``Ampere``,
``Blackwell``) and inferred forward-compatible cubins the caller never asked
for.  WarpConvNet keeps the build contract deliberately small: every requested
token maps to exactly one cubin target.  A ``+PTX`` suffix adds PTX only when
it was explicitly requested; it never adds a second cubin, and no architecture
is ever inferred from another one being present.

This module intentionally has no torch dependency.  ``setup.py`` loads it by
file path (without importing any package ``__init__``), so the parsing and
validation logic is covered by CPU-only tests that need neither a GPU nor a
CUDA-enabled PyTorch build.
